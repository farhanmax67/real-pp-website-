                        <h3>What is Chess?</h3>
                        <p>Chess is a two-player strategy game played on an 8x8 board with 64 squares. Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Chessboard</h3>
                        <p>The chessboard has 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The squares alternate between light and dark colors. When setting up the board, the bottom-right square should be light-colored.</p>
                        
                        <div class="chess-board-demo">

                        <h3>Setting Up the Board</h3>
                        <p>Place the board so each player has a light square on their right. The pieces are arranged as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Back row (from left to right):</strong> Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook</li>
                            <li><strong>Front row:</strong> Eight pawns</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> The queen always starts on her own color (white queen on white square, black queen on black square).</p>

                            <h4>💭 Reflection Question</h4>
                            <p>Why do you think chess uses a board with alternating colors? How might this help players during the game?</p>

                    <h2>Understanding Chess Pieces</h2>
                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        <h3>The King ♔</h3>
                        <p>The king is the most important piece. You lose if your king is captured (checkmated). The king moves one square in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Protecting your king teaches you to prioritize what's most important and think about safety and security.</p>

                        <h3>The Queen ♕</h3>
                        <p>The queen is the most powerful piece. She can move any number of squares in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> The queen's versatility shows the value of adaptability and having multiple options in problem-solving.</p>

                        <h3>The Rook ♖</h3>
                        <p>The rook moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically (in straight lines).</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Rooks teach us about direct action and clear, straightforward approaches to goals.</p>

                        <h3>The Bishop ♗</h3>
                        <p>The bishop moves any number of squares diagonally. Each player starts with two bishops: one on light squares and one on dark squares.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Bishops show us that different perspectives (light vs. dark squares) can both be valuable.</p>

                        <h3>The Knight ♘</h3>
                        <p>The knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in one direction, then one square perpendicular. Knights are the only pieces that can "jump over" other pieces.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Knights teach us that sometimes unconventional approaches can be effective and that obstacles can be overcome creatively.</p>

                        <h3>The Pawn ♙</h3>
                        <p>Pawns move forward one square at a time (or two squares on their first move). They capture diagonally. If a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any piece (usually a queen).</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Pawns show us that small, consistent progress can lead to great achievements. They remind us that everyone starts somewhere and can grow.</p>

                <div class="lesson-panel" id="rules">
                    <h2>Chess Rules</h2>
                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        <h3>How to Win</h3>
                        <p>You win by checkmating your opponent's king. This means the king is under attack (in check) and cannot escape.</p>

                        <h3>Check and Checkmate</h3>
                        <p><strong>Check:</strong> When your king is under attack, you must get out of check on your next move. You can do this by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Moving the king to a safe square</li>
                            <li>Blocking the attack with another piece</li>
                            <li>Capturing the attacking piece</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Checkmate:</strong> When the king is in check and cannot escape, the game ends. The player who checkmates wins.</p>

                        <h3>Special Rules</h3>
                        <p><strong>Castling:</strong> A special move involving the king and a rook. The king moves two squares toward a rook, and the rook jumps over to the square next to the king. You can only castle if neither piece has moved, there are no pieces between them, and the king is not in check.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>En Passant:</strong> A special pawn capture that can occur when a pawn moves two squares forward and lands next to an opponent's pawn.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Pawn Promotion:</strong> When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any piece (usually a queen).</p>

                        <h3>Draws</h3>
                        <p>A game can end in a draw (tie) in several ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stalemate: A player cannot make a legal move but is not in check</li>
                            <li>Insufficient material: Neither player has enough pieces to checkmate</li>
                            <li>Threefold repetition: The same position occurs three times</li>
                            <li>Agreement: Both players agree to a draw</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Chess Openings</h2>
                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        <h3>What is an Opening?</h3>
                        <p>The opening is the first phase of the game, usually the first 10-15 moves. Good opening play sets up your pieces for the middle game and helps control the center of the board.</p>

                        <h3>Opening Principles</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Control the Center:</strong> The center squares (e4, e5, d4, d5) are important because pieces placed there have more mobility.</li>
                            <li><strong>Develop Your Pieces:</strong> Get your knights and bishops into active positions early.</li>
                            <li><strong>Castle Early:</strong> Protect your king by castling, usually within the first 10 moves.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't Move the Same Piece Twice:</strong> Develop different pieces rather than moving one piece multiple times.</li>
                            <li><strong>Don't Bring Out the Queen Too Early:</strong> The queen is powerful but can be attacked easily if brought out too soon.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Popular Beginner Openings</h3>
                        <p><strong>Italian Game:</strong> 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 - A solid opening that develops pieces quickly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ruy Lopez:</strong> 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 - One of the most popular and respected openings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Queen's Gambit:</strong> 1. d4 d5 2. c4 - A strategic opening focusing on controlling the center.</p>

                <div class="lesson-panel" id="tactics">
                    <h2>Chess Tactics</h2>
                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        <h3>What are Tactics?</h3>
                        <p>Tactics are short-term sequences of moves that gain an advantage, such as winning material or checkmating. Tactics are the building blocks of chess skill.</p>

                        <h3>Common Tactical Patterns</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Fork</h4>
                        <p>A fork occurs when one piece attacks two or more enemy pieces at the same time. Knights are excellent at forking because of their unique movement.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Forks teach us to look for opportunities where one action can achieve multiple goals.</p>

                        <h4>Pin</h4>
                        <p>A pin occurs when a piece cannot move because it would expose a more valuable piece behind it. Bishops, rooks, and queens can create pins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Life Skill Connection:</strong> Pins show us how constraints can limit our options and the importance of protecting valuable resources.</p>

                        <h4>Skewer</h4>
                        <p>Similar to a pin, but the more valuable piece is in front. When it moves, the less valuable piece behind is captured.</p>

                        <h4>Discovered Attack</h4>
                        <p>When moving one piece reveals an attack by another piece behind it. This can be very powerful!</p>

                        <h4>Double Check</h4>
                        <p>When two pieces attack the enemy king simultaneously. The king must move (cannot block or capture both).</p>

                        <div class="interactive-quiz">

                    <h2>Basic Chess Strategy</h2>
                    <div class="lesson-text">
                        <h3>What is Strategy?</h3>
                        <p>While tactics are short-term combinations, strategy is the long-term plan. Good strategy involves understanding the position and making plans based on the strengths and weaknesses of both sides.</p>

                        <h3>Key Strategic Concepts</h3>
                        
                        <h4>Piece Activity</h4>
                        <p>Active pieces are more valuable than passive ones. Try to place your pieces on squares where they control important areas and have many options.</p>

                        <h4>Pawn Structure</h4>
                        <p>The arrangement of pawns affects the game. Weak pawns (isolated, doubled, or backward) can be targets. Strong pawn structures support your pieces.</p>

                        <h4>King Safety</h4>
                        <p>Always consider your king's safety. An exposed king is vulnerable to attacks. Keep your king protected, especially in the opening and middle game.</p>

                        <h4>Material vs. Position</h4>
                        <p>Sometimes it's worth sacrificing material (giving up a piece) for a better position or attack. This requires careful calculation and judgment.</p>

                        <h4>Time (Tempo)</h4>
                        <p>Each move is valuable. Don't waste moves. Try to develop your pieces efficiently and make moves that serve multiple purposes.</p>

                        <h3>Planning</h3>
                        <p>Good chess players always have a plan. Ask yourself:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What are the weaknesses in my opponent's position?</li>
                            <li>What are the strengths of my position?</li>
                            <li>What is my opponent trying to do?</li>
                            <li>What is the best way to improve my position?</li>
                        </ul>
